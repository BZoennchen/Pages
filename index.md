Welcome, everyone! 
I'm Benedikt, a postdoctoral researcher in applied machine learning at the at the [Munich Center for Digital Science and AI](https://sites.hm.edu/mucdai/), part of the [Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences (HM)](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html).
My current research explores the societal impact of artificial intelligence, particularly in the domains of education, art, and communication.

My academic journey began with a strong foundation in theoretical computer science during my master's studies, where I focused on automata theory, logic, complexity theory, and approximation and online algorithms. 
I later transitioned to modeling and simulation, pursuing a Ph.D. in the field of pedestrian dynamics.

In my doctoral research, I specialized in large-scale pedestrian simulations, analyzing various microscopic models and developing efficient parallel algorithms
Notably, I investigated dynamic navigation field computation in changing environments---a problem closely related to solving the Eikonal equation efficiently.
I also introduced parallelism to the [optimal steps models](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.86.046108), a key class of microscopic simulation models developed by our research group.

I earned my Ph.D. at the [Chair of Scientific Computing in Computer Science (SCCS)](https://www.in.tum.de/i05/startseite/), [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/cover-page/), in cooperation with Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences (HM).
During this time, I was an active member of the [Pedestrian Research Group](https://www.cs.hm.edu/forschungprojekte/pedestrian_dynamics/index.de.html) and a core contributor to the open-source pedestrian simulation framework [Vadere](http://www.vadere.org).

Today, my interests have broadened to include the communicative capacity of AI systems and their transformative influence on society. 
As digital technologies become central to our way of life, I believe computer scientists must help shape this transformation---not as unchecked forces of progress, but as thoughtful enablers of one of the most vital interdisciplinary projects of our time.

At the heart of this project lies a philosophical conviction: we can be Nietzschian to **make life interesting** and Kantian to **make life bearable**.
This principle also informs my fascination with creative coding, where programming transcends utility and becomes a mode of artistic expression.
For me, code is not merely a tool for building applications---it is a medium for expression, a form of art, a way to couple mind and world, and an end in itself.

Computer science, at its best, opens the door to autonomy and agency, creativity and imagination, beauty and freedom---in short:

>"a world open for play."  -- Robin Williams

Teaching, in this light, should be an invitation into that playful world---a path to self-discovery, agancy, autonomy and individuation.
While it is widely accepted that computational thinking is an important skill, I believe computer science has the potential to offer far more than utility. 
It can---and should---be meaningful.
As a scientific discipline, it should remain open to critique and mature enough to engage with other fields, learning from their perspectives.
