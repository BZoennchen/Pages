# Software

## Visualizations

The following collection of animations has neither a particular purpose nor any utility apart from my enjoyment.
I created them by using the JavaScript Library [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).

+ [Perpendicular Symmetric Parallel Branching](snowflake/)
+ [Global-mean Monthly Temperature](temperature/)
+ [Rotating Lines](rotation/)
+ [Space-filling Curve](sierpinski/)
+ [Elastic Collision](collisions/)
+ [Discrete Voronoi Diagran](voronoi/)
+ [Fourier Drawing](fourier/)
+ [Forest Fire Simulation](fire/)
+ [Fractal Tree](tree/)

## Roboworld

[roboworld](https://robo-world-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) is an educational Python package designed for students to learn basic programming concepts, such as,

+ variables,
+ function calls,
+ conditionals,
+ loops and
+ recursion.

Students must navigate Robo (a robot) through different two-dimensional discrete Worlds. Robo represents a very simplistic machine that can only deal with elementary instructions, i.e., method calls. Therefore, students have to extend the missing functionality step by step. Through this process they learn

1. to divide a problem into smaller pieces,
2. to abstract,
3. to recognize patterns, and
4. to design and implement algorithms.

roboworld is heavily inspired by [Kara](https://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/kara/index.html).
You can install the package via ``pip``:

```
pip install roboworld
```

You can find a complete example of a student assignment [here](https://github.com/BZoennchen/ct-ws2022-students/blob/main/solutions/training05/CT-Roboworld.ipynb).

## Vadere

From 2016 to 2020 I was a main contributor to [Vadere](http://www.vadere.org/).
It is an open-source framework for the simulation of microscopic pedestrian and crowd dynamics. 
In addition to this core domain, other systems including cars and granular flow can be introduced into the framework.

## EikMesh

During my Ph.D. I created [EikMesh](http://www.vadere.org/the-eikmesh-library/), a Java library for high quality meshes. 
It is part of Vadere and was developed to generate high quality meshes for spatial discretization in the domain of pedestrian dynamics.

# Writing

I love writing not only to create something but also sharpen my own understanding of something.
Therefore, I started to write educational online books.

## Computational Thinking

I wrote an interactive book for the course *[Computational Thinking](https://bzoennchen.github.io/ct-book/intro.html)* which I am teaching at the Munich University of Applied Sciences.
The book is currently only available in German.

## Algorithmic Composition

I am currently writing an online book about *[Algorithmic Compositions](https://bzoennchen.github.io/supercollider-book/intro.html#)* which includes topics such as

+ Computer Music with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)
+ Sound Design with SuperCollider
+ Music Theory
+ ...

It is a free time / hobby project.
