I remember watching *HOME* in 2010.
It is a French documentary directed by *Yann Arthus-Bertrand* and composed of beautiful shots of various and diverse places on Earth.
We can criticize the film for multiple reasons.
For example, its birds eye view which makes even people searching in pile of garbage or the yawning ground in Madagasca kind of aesthetically pleasing.
Futhermore, the film was financed by members of the *PPR group*, i.e., Gucci, Puma, and other producers of luxary goods.
However, the movie had definitly an impact on my behaviour as a consumer.
At that time, getting reminded about our unsustainable and exploitative way of life was important for me since sustainability wasn't a daily, weekly or even monthly topic to me.

In 2011 I prepared a presentation for my application to join the *Studienstiftung* and decided to talk about *The Psychology of Climate Change*.
The topic was likely motivated by the movie and the fact that unsustainability is an age old state the human species has introduced. 
The environment of such gatherings gives you a good impression of what is on the students mind.
In 2011, the topic wasn't "mainstream".
If I remember correctly, within a group of 40 students, I was the only one talking about climate change.
The topic felt old and completed and at the same time unreal and distant, like everything was already said and other things were far more important.
Today, the climate change and sustainability is at the right and center within these gatherings.

I wanted to start the article by this little story to emphasis that even if the future looks grim, something has already changed.
The time for movies like *HOME* is over.
It is time to accelerate the required transformation by looking for weapons to effectivly implement systemic adaptations such that new generations will ask

>How have you done it?
