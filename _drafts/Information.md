title:  "Information"
---

We are riding on a train to our beautiful hometown.
Suddenly, the integrated monitor in our compartment displays the current weather and a forecast for the day.
The sun is shining and we do not have to worry about any nasty rain.
We put our jacket into our backpack. 

This simple example shows our general understanding of information.
The weather service (a *sender*) transmitted via a network (a *information channel*) the weather forecast (*information*) to us (*receiver*) and it *impacted* us in our behavior.
The delivered information eliminated or at least reduced the uncertainty of the upcoming weather situation -- we are ensured that it will most certainly not rain.
Consequently, we put our jacket into our backpack.

One might think that by studying computer science, students receive a deep understanding about what *information* is.
Information, is a fundamental resource they deal with all the time.
So shouldn't they learn what it acutally is?
Well, most computer scientists (me included) have a shallow encounter with the term.
Thinking back to my own study experience, I remember that we established Shannon's definition of information using his notion of entropie.
We spent like one or two sessions on the topic and moved on.

There are different reason for this unsatifying encounter with the term.
Historically, a deep understanding of information was never important to get things done.
Furthermore, the term has many different definitions.
And lastly, the term is oversaturated in our daily life.
We think we already know what information is because we use it and its intuitive definition all the time.

The digital is here to stay.
We will integrate more and more systems into our lifes that make decisions for us.
Therefore, it is necessary to think deeply about those systems.
And one major component is the material they are processing, that is, information!

## Objective and Subjective Meaning

Let me ask you something: does a computer know the meaning of a number?


A computer or a program does not have any notion of meaning.
Hard- and Software work on a purely syntactical basis.
They merely manipulate bits and bytes, symbols and states.
A computer does not know what a number is, nonetheless we use computers to perform numerical calculations.
This is possible because of interpretations $$I$$, i.e. functions that map a *representative* $$r$$ to its *objective meaning* $$I(r)$$.
For example, a 4-bit-adder interprets a series of bits as whole number: $$I(0111) = 7$$.

By definition, artifical intelligence (AI) attach meaning to information.
Where traditional information processes interpret bits and byte syntactically, AI adds semantics to information.
For example, by analyzing the needs of customers and the state of the housing market, an AI might suggest that you by that one house within the next month.
This suggestion can be more or less subtle.
Maybe the best matches are listed on a webpage.

If we think about it, it becomes clear that whenever information gets exposed to us, meaning is already attached to it.
It lies in the choice of presentation.
This presentation always communicates with us.
This relationship between information and its presentation is similar to a movie that can not really be apolitical.



However, it is easy for us to inject a metric that categorises and values those series of symbols.

In general, it is difficult to find pure syntactical interpreters as soon as information is preceived by us.
