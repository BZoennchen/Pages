The word *digital* usually refers to something represented, processed, or communicated using discrete values rather than continuous signals.
We know that digital systems encode information in binary (0/1) rather than analog waveforms. A digital clock displays exact numbers; an analog clock sweeps smoothly. Digital data is stored and transmitted as discrete units (bits and bytes), not continuous signals.

But we often forget: *symbols*---the words of our languages---are also digital. They, too, compress complexity into discrete units. Human language is a digital system of signs, even when carried by analog sound waves.

And here lies a crucial implication: there are no ultimate foundations or essences in language, no *ground* beneath our signs, even though we act as if there were.

Programming seems to offer firmer ground. Classes, objects, and definitions feel well-formed, precise, and self-contained. We call this *semantics*. Yet even here, meaning is not given by the machine. Meaning arises because I, as a programmer, interpret and use the system. The code works or fails, delights or frustrates, earns money, sells goods, plays music, organizes life. Meaning is not in the code itself but in the observed effects it produces and the uses we make of it. And even this meaning is mediated by natural language---so we are already outside the pure formal system.

Now step further outward into everyday life, and the ambiguity multiplies. What does it mean to call someone a "mother"? There is no essence of "mother". Instead, there is a shifting pattern of experiences: shelter, protection, food, conflict, laughter, school lessons, beginnings, and countless other associations. A mother is not a father, not a flower, not a lake---but a fluid constellation of relations and meanings. It is also a *trace*.

What is a person? A human being?
Is it a subject?
Is it some constant structure?

A person, too, is a pattern of modulated repetition.
It seems coherent over time because it has habits and reoccurring desires, aspirations and flaws.
It is a process, not a fixed essence.
A person is a complex system, like a hurricane. 
And this observation is itself made by another hurricane, being observed by other hurricanes---and each of those is part of the conditions of the others.

This brings me to why I am irritated with reporting, especially these days. Reporting habitually ignores such complexity. Yes, communication requires compression. But must it always collapse into simple binaries: right/wrong, good/evil, friend/foe? Must every event and person be reduced to a single label that fits neatly into our networks of signs?

In the end, all this complexity is reduced to a profile, a list of characteristics---or worse, to a simple judgment: good or evil. But hurricanes are neither good nor evil. They can destroy, they can endanger, they can force us to run or hide. But if we want to change them, we cannot moralize them---we must change the conditions under which they form and transform.

People can be criminals and kind. They can support terror and suffer horrific cruelty. They can be incredible poets and support the Nazi party. And I can recognize this with an "**and**" instead of a "**but**".

There is no way out of this complexity. There is only more complexity.

I know it is not possible to report without compression. I am compressing right now. But can't we do better? Must it always be only right and wrong, good and evil, friend and foe? Must every event and every person be collapsed into a single dot that fits neatly into our networks of signs?

It seems increasingly difficult to escape our *digital condition* where the lifeworld is increasingly structured by discrete representations, code, and networks---where the richness of experience is flattened into simplified, exchangeable symbols that can be used and abused to make sense and to draw simple conclusions which leads to yet another hurricane.
