Hello! I'm Benedikt, an educational-tech software engineer for educational tools and advisor for computer science education at the [Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS)](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html) at the Faculty of Informatics and Mathematics.

I graduated at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/cover-page/) with a master's degree in computer science in 2016.

Afterward, I continued my academic journey by joining the computer science PhD program in the field of pedestrian dynamics.
In my research, I was interested in realistic large-scale pedestrian simulation. 
I analyzed different microscopic pedestrian simulation models and studied efficient parallel algorithms for pedestrian simulation.
In particular, I discussed and analyzed navigation field computation in a large-scale setting. 
The problem is strongly connected to solving the [eikonal equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eikonal_equation).
Furthermore, I introduced parallelism to the so-called optimal steps models, an essential class of microscopic simulation models.
Consequently, I was able to run large-scale simulations in real-time using the GPU.
I did my PhD at the [Chair of Scientific Computing in Computer Science (SCCS)](https://www.in.tum.de/i05/startseite/) of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/cover-page/) in cooperation with the [Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS)](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html).
During that time, I worked as a software developer on the open-source framework for pedestrian simulation [Vadere](http:/www.vadere.org) at the [Pedestrian Research Group](https://www.cs.hm.edu/forschungprojekte/pedestrian_dynamics/index.de.html) in Munich.

Today I am working as a software engineer at the [MUAS](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html).
I am also taking part in the educational environment and process.
In addition, I try to comfort my desire to teach young people by working as a contract lecturer as often as possible.

Apart from modeling and simulating pedestrian streams, I am interested in algorithms and their expressiveness in a more general sense.
I want to explore coding beyond communicating with a machine, beyond being work, and beyond being the logical formal thing we use to build applications.
Coding is not only an art form but can be the means to express oneself through art.
By doing so, I discovered a new rabbit hole.
I am drawn to programming art in the form of music (using [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), [TidalCycle](https://tidalcycles.org/), [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org/) and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)) and animations (using [Processing](https://processing.org/), [P5js](https://p5js.org/)).

For me, computer science is a door into a world of self-determination, creativity, imagination, beauty, and freedom; in short, 

>"A world open for play." 

To steal some words from [Robin Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams).

In essence, teaching computer science should be an invitation to this playful world.
The digital is here to stay; therefore, computer science is precious and versatile.
It seems that we concluded that everyone should know how to code, at least a little bit.
However, I firmly believe it can and must be more than useful!
