Welcome, everyone! I'm Benedikt, and I am currently working on improving our computer science education using my skills as a software engineer and lecturer at the [Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS)](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html) at the Faculty of Informatics and Mathematics.

During my master's program, I had the opportunity to focus primarily on theory-heavy subjects such as automata theory, logic, complexity theory, approximation and online algorithms.

I continued my academic journey by joining the computer science Ph.D. program in the field of pedestrian dynamics switching from theoretical computer science to modeling and simulation.
In my research, I was interested in realistic large-scale pedestrian simulation. 
I analyzed different microscopic pedestrian simulation models and studied efficient parallel algorithms for pedestrian simulation.
In particular, I discussed and analyzed navigation field computation in a large-scale setting -- a problem that is strongly connected to solving the eikonal equation.
Furthermore, I introduced parallelism to the so-called optimal steps models, an essential class of microscopic simulation models.
I did my Ph.D. at the [Chair of Scientific Computing in Computer Science (SCCS)](https://www.in.tum.de/i05/startseite/) of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/cover-page/) in cooperation with the Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS).
During that time, I was a member of the [Pedestrian Research Group](https://www.cs.hm.edu/forschungprojekte/pedestrian_dynamics/index.de.html) in Munich and a major contributor to the open-source framework for pedestrian simulation [Vadere](http:/www.vadere.org).

Apart from modeling and simulating pedestrian streams, I am interested in the effect of the communicating ability of artificial intelligence and algorithms and their impact on societies.
I am heavily drawn to the idea of creating art via code, i.e., coding beyond communicating with a machine, beyond being work, and beyond being the logical formal thing we use to build applications.
In my opinion, coding is not only an art form but a medium through which we can express ourselves.

For me, computer science is a door into a world of self-determination, creativity, imagination, beauty, and freedom; in short: 

>"a world open for play."  -- Robin Williams

Teaching computer science should be an invitation to this playful world.
The digital is here to stay; therefore, computer science is precious and versatile.
It seems that we concluded that everyone should know how to code, at least a little bit.
However, I firmly believe it can and must be more than useful!
