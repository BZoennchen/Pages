There is tension between music compostions and algorithms, between performance and program execution, between emotion and calculation.
On the one hand, we think of composing, performing and listening to music as a deeply emotional humanistic activity.
Music evokes feelings, it has psychological effects on the listener but also on its creators.
When I listen to music at the right moment it has the ability to color my perception of the world; it can be world-defining, be it disturbing and dark, melancholic and yearning, sensible and loving, or live-affirming and innocent.
On the other hand, algorithms and their execution are attributed with cold and inhumane calculations.
On the surface, neihter do they evoke feelings nor are they (or their execution) aesthetically pleasing.
The latter can be disputed easly.
Similar to mathematical proofs, algorithms can be intelectually aesthetic and their presentation can be beautiful as well.
The same is true for musical compositions.
We can look at a piece from Bach and wonder about its elegance and finesse.

The field of algorithmic composition threatens this viewpoint directly.
