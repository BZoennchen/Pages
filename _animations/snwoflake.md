# Symmetric Parallel Branching

The following animation is pure *generative art*.
It starts with a single line that branches with a certain probability.
Each new line has a smaller final length and can branch again but with decreasing probability.
Every branch is perpendicular to its parent.
Everything is copied cyclically multiple times to achieve a high degree of symmetry.
