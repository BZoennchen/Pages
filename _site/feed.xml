  &lt;p&gt;“The objection that computing is not a science because it studies man-made objects (technologies) is a red herring. Computer science studies information processes both artificial and natural.”&lt;br /&gt; - Peter J. Denning &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#denning:2005&quot;&gt; [1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me personally, informatics is an empowering discipline - it is part of the emancipation of men. 
Its engineering quality can directly enable our fragile and limited body and mind. 
But its magic goes beyond practical use. Similar to mathematics, we discover its beauty in an abstract world. 
This Platonian world consists of fantastic, imaginative objects we can recognize, build and play with. 
In it, the problems of men are absent. 
There is no morality, no judgment, no conflict, no othering but harmony to enjoy, complex structures to discover, riddles to unravel, and logic-based creativity to get lost in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;informatics-is-an-art&quot;&gt;Informatics is an Art&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In popular culture, coding is often portrayed as something conspicuously ‘nerdy’ and alienating.
A usually white ‘creepy’ man writes his code by typing seamlessly and rapidly into a black terminal.
He never stops, he never interacts with other beings, and he never leaves his desk.
Of course, everything works perfectly on the first try, and no one else seems to have any clue what’s going on.
Intellectually, the programmer stands above everyone else; he is a genius, a mad scientist, or introverted weirdo - only so important to do the necessary work and enable the ‘real’ hero.
This toxic depiction of software developers (and introverted people) is wrong, dated, and was never accurate in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outside, coding looks like the most boring thing on Earth.
This assessment is, of course, utterly wrong!
Writing programs is a beautiful, creative and interactive process.
To somebody who does it, it is the most exciting thing in the world.
It is a game of chess but much more involving because you can make up your own rules and build your own world.
Elementary entities accumulate to something bigger, something interconnected.
The degree of freedom and creativity this process of creation offers can hardly be explained or understood if one never experienced it first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no way does programming start in isolation at the computer, and in no way can we do it seamlessly.
It is neither a purely analytical nor a purely experimental process.
Like writing an interesting story, it is a struggle, always!
If it isn’t, we or someone else already solved the puzzle - the exciting part has been gone.
In that case, we do not create but translate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the fascinating facts is that, in the end, everything comes down to simple symbol manipulations, which we call information processes.
Software developers scoop, transform, and use information.
They design data structures, and algorithms like architects draw construction plans.
Additionally, they have the power to build, combine, reuse and extend those objects of structured information.
They command machines of blind obedience.
The degree of control translates to a form of power and self-determination absent in the physical world.
As Linus Torvalds rightfully noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[Phyisics and computer science] are about how the world works at a rather fundamental level. The difference, of course, is that while in physics, you are supposed to figure out how the world is made up, in computer science, you create the world. Within the confines of the computer, you are the creator. You get ultimate control over everything that happens. If you are good enough, you can be God on a small scale.” - Linus Torvalds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to most other kinds of engineers, software developers can use a highly flexible and versatile resource.
Information can be easily exchanged among peers, reshaped, conceptually described, and analyzed.
In fact, it manipulates itself since any program is nothing more than well-structured information.
Like many other materialized ideas, structured information arises from human thoughts; they result from a mental exercise.
But the transformation of thoughts into objects of structured information is immediate.
It is like writing a poem.
Therefore, it can be an entirely personal and connecting experience to read the code, i.e., thoughts, of someone else.
Over time, one learns to appreciate good code - its structure, aesthetic, modularity, level of abstraction, simplicity, consistency, and elegance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we look beyond the code, beyond ideas written down in text snippets, programs are written to be executed.
And those programs can serve almost any domain.
They control robots, harvest semantic information, control networks of devices, simulate the natural world and other virtual worlds.
They establish communication channels, send messages with the speed of light across the earth, compose and play music, and constantly search for structures in a rapidly increasing number of data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the end, functionality is second to being exciting or pretty.
Even coding itself is secondary.
Figuring out how things work is the real deal.
Since everything is self-consistent and logical, you can go on and on and never stop exploring.
It is an endless stream, too immense for one lifetime.
And you are not even bound to some external logic; you can make up your own as long as it is consistent.
This consistency is a bright contrast to the social and political world - it’s like going home to a place where everything is comprehensible, a place where you can find some truth within the bounds of its rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;informatics-is-a-science&quot;&gt;Informatics is a Science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer, I want to build large architectures that process information.
In the world of physical objects, we have to study the properties of certain materials and the laws of physics to guarantee that our buildings do not collapse and behave expectedly.
But how can we specify and verify structured information?
How can we even define what we can compute?
What is computable?
Is sorting cards equally &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; as solving a Sudoku?
Here we enter yet another world, a formal one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, those two worlds are never entirely separated.
Formal methods and objects, like the Turing Machine, the Lambda Calculus, logic, grammars, and automata are the mathematical backbones of informatics.
They are a particular kind of mathematically rigorous description of information manipulation (computation).
By analyzing those objects, we get to the very fundamental and interesting questions.
I was never hooked by the purpose of formal methods in software development (verification and specification).
Instead, I found them intrinsically fascinating!
It was just enough to discover these formal, therefore, clearly defined objects.
Again, it is tough to explain this attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start with a set of unambiguous definitions: an alphabet, a word over an alphabet, a tuple of a set of states, a transition function, and so on.
And you begin to construct slightly more and more powerful objects while analyzing the properties of these objects.
You always try to keep their power controllable.
Their properties should stay computable - you enter the realm of constructivism.
You begin to recognize the equivalence of objects from completely different fields such as logic and automata theory.
And you form beautiful proofs about very abstract thus general statements of your formally constructed world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, you arrive at a formal model of any digital computer, that is, the &lt;em&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/em&gt;.
Since you now have this gift, this formal model, you can analyze it in a highly abstract way.
You can define what a computer at least requires to be &lt;em&gt;Turing-complete&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., to be a computer.
You can define what &lt;em&gt;computable&lt;/em&gt; is, and you can even measure how many steps it takes to solve a class of problems.
You start analyzing the &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; of problems, such as sorting cards or solving a Sudoku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, sorting cards (on a &lt;em&gt;Turing-complete&lt;/em&gt; model) requires \(\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))\) steps, where \(n\) is the number of cards.
And we know that we can not do better than that.
Consequently, in the worst case, sorting cards requires always at least \(c \cdot n\log(n)\) steps where \(c\) is some constant independent of \(n\).
Isn’t that captivating that we know this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the still &lt;strong&gt;unanswered&lt;/strong&gt; question if solving a Sudoku is as hard as checking a solution of it?
We call this&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathcal{NP} \stackrel{?}{=} \mathcal{P}\]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, we ask again in the context of &lt;em&gt;Turing Machines&lt;/em&gt;.
Therefore, one might argue that this is not a scientific question because we ask for some property of some human-made machine.
I strongly disagree!
This machine is a mathematical object, and mathematics is the language of nature.
To this day, &lt;em&gt;Turing Machines&lt;/em&gt; are THE model for computation (Lambda Calculus is equivalent).
If nature does compute, we might even study its very, very basic principles!
Doesn’t it feel so much harder to solve a Sudoku than checking its solution?
Isn’t there a fundamental difference?
Or isn’t finding a proof much harder than understanding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a solution involves what we call creativity and intuition.
But checking it is a rather automatable process.
So if we reframe the question, we may ask for the complexity of creativity!
Since hundreds of publications falsely claimed to have solved the question, it seems to require a lot of creativity to grasp the complexity of creativity correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a fascinating question to tackle!
Clearly, this is science.
It is not natural science but similar to mathematics, a formal science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, you encounter another significant problem: the &lt;em&gt;Halting problem&lt;/em&gt;.
It states that there will never be a program (definable as a Turing Machine) that can test for an arbitrary program that it halts.
To understand the theorem and its proof in-dept feels groundbreaking and infinitely satisfying.
If you understand how computers, i.e., &lt;em&gt;Turing Machines&lt;/em&gt;, work, the proof is simple and beautiful.
You can find a sketch of it in the appendix of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-informatics&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Informatics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roots-of-informatics&quot;&gt;Roots of Informatics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is kind of funny that historically, informatics first struggled for recognition on a global scale.
In academia, this struggle has been gone.
However, in the general public’s eye, the objective and research subject of the discipline is blurred, which still leads to confusion:
yes, I am a computer scientist, but neither will I fix your computer nor your software bugs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look into the history books, computer scientists had to fight to establish their field. The discipline emerged out of certain branches such as electrical engineering, physics, and mathematics.
In the 1960s, computer science comes into its own as a discipline. Georg Forsythe, a numerical analyst, coined the term.
The first computer science department was formed at Purdue University in 1962.
The first person to receive a PhD from a computer science department was Richard Wexelblat, at the University of Pennsylvania, in December 1965.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, informatics goes back to the Institute for Practical Mathematics (IPM) at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt, founded around 1928.
But it required time to establish the first informatics course by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Darmstadt.
The first doctoral thesis was written in 1975, ten years later compared to the US.
In my hometown, the first informatics course at the Technical University of Munich was offered in 1967 at the Department of Mathematics.
In 1992, the Department of Informatics split up from the Department of Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informatics can still be regarded as relatively young compared to other well-established disciplines such as physics, chemistry, or psychology. Nonetheless, new fields split up from informatics, and they are all interlinked with one another. We have, for example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;scientific computing,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;computational science,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;information theory,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and linguistic,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the list goes on.
The problem of artificial intelligence (AI) brings informatics more and more in touch with humanities such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;philosophy,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;psychology,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and neurosciences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-disappearance-of-classical-informatics&quot;&gt;The Disappearance of ‘Classical’ Informatics?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the field of informatics, there are a lot of branches one can pursue, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;formal methods and complexity theory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;programming languages and compilers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;design and analysis of algorithms and data structures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;parallel and distributed computation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;high-performance computation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;networks and communication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;intelligent systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operating systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cybersecurity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;databases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data science&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;computer graphics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;image processing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;modeling and simulation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;software engineering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;architecture and organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sprawling list of specialties indicates no longer such thing as a classical computer scientist, right? 
Nobody can be an expert in all of those areas - it is just impossible! Over the years, some branches lost, and others gained attraction, but most of them are active.
For example, we lost interest in operating systems but put more effort into investigating high-performance computation and data science.
Theoretical informatics cooled down, but there are still many critical questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this abundant variety, being a computer scientist is more than being an expert in one specific field.
It is more than knowing how to build large software systems, manage networks, process data and establish a secure infrastructure.
&lt;strong&gt;It is a way of thinking!&lt;/strong&gt; And no, we do not think like computers but embrace the curiosity naturally given to us human beings.
We renew the playing child within us and let it go wild to solve riddles for no particular reason. 
And I think that is one of the most human things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-perspective-on-information&quot;&gt;A New Perspective on Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this little supplementary section, I want to talk about the resource we are working with: information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may notice, I call &lt;strong&gt;computer science&lt;/strong&gt; by the European term &lt;strong&gt;informatics&lt;/strong&gt;.
But not only because I am from Europe but also because the term leans more towards &lt;strong&gt;information&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;computation&lt;/strong&gt;.
Information manipulation is computation, but it emphasizes a more abstract broader definition of computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information, as we understand it is the elimination of uncertainties but on a purely &lt;strong&gt;syntactical&lt;/strong&gt; level.
This notion dates back to 1948 and was defined by Claude E. Shannon in &lt;em&gt;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correleted according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities.
These smenatic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.
The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.
The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.” &lt;br /&gt;- Claude E. Shannon &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#shannon:1948&quot;&gt; [2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the humanities, researchers have a completely different understanding of information.
They discuss cognition, representations, referencing, and interpretation in the context of information.
What does a symbol mean, and what effect, or interpretation does it has?
How does data transform into information, and how do we harvest knowledge and wisdom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of information transmitted via a technical channel, a purely syntactical perspective is appropriate.
But it seems inappropriate if we discuss today’s information-driven society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, We can rapidly collect unimaginable amounts of information.
It can be processed automatically and checked for higher-level patterns that would not be discernible without technology.
We constantly transform information into a machine-readable format, which makes it, in turn, quantifiable.
But is there information that is not machine-readable, and do we dismiss it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futhermore, the interconnected world of information processes of today never forgets anything.
Incessantly, it sucks up data and floods our private and public spaces with it.
It is like a magical beast that can create amazing miracles but can also cause devastating destructions - sometimes it appears as a lovely creature, and sometimes it embodies a frightening monster.
We have to deal with it!
It is our creation - an artificial intelligence that already evaluates, categorizes, interprets, and generates information on its own.
It has to include the semantics of information. 
Otherwise, it would be difficult to call it &lt;em&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we left the task of pure information transformation a long time ago, we need the perspective of the humanities - we have to think beyond pure syntax.
In fact, we have to reconsider the term &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt;, at least in our discipline.
For example, Ulrich states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where data are the raw facts of the world, information is then data ‘with meaning’.
When ‘data’ acquires context-dependent meaning and relevance, it becomes information. 
Furthermore, we obviously expect information to represent valid knowledge on which users can rely for rational action. &lt;br /&gt;- W. Ulrich &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ulrich:2001&quot;&gt; [3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even this definition seems problematic.
Is there even something like simple brute facts of the world?
All data seem to be already gathered and processed.
Therefore, information can not simply be the injection of meaning into data because data already has meaning.
It is more like that the individual degree of significance differs.
What might be meaningful to me might be utterly meaningless to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we can not answer this question of an adequate definition here.
But to disregard it entirely and leave the design of interconnected information processes solely to the technicians would be a mistake.
Discovering, studying, using, influencing, and extending our interconnected world of information processing, is exciting as well as necessary.
It is part of our duties, but we should no longer encounter this beast alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-halting-problem&quot;&gt;The Halting Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me try to give you the intuition of the &lt;em&gt;Halting problem&lt;/em&gt;.
For simplicity reasons, I will not explicitly distinguish between a &lt;em&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathcal{T}\) and its description (often noted by \(\alpha_\mathcal{T}\)).
So when a &lt;em&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/em&gt; gets as input another &lt;em&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/em&gt;, I mean its description (source code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us assume there is a &lt;em&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathcal{H}\) that takes an arbitrary &lt;em&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathcal{T}\) as input.
\(\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{T})\) outputs 1 if \(\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{T})\) halts, otherwise it outputs 0.
So if such a program exists, \(\mathcal{H}\) is the program that solves the &lt;em&gt;Halting problem&lt;/em&gt;, and \(\mathcal{T}\) is an arbitrary program.
We can pick \(\mathcal{T}\) as its own input because the input can be arbitrary (but finite).
So we ‘feed’ the program \(\mathcal{T}\) with itself, that is, its own description/source code \(\mathcal{T}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{equation} \tag{1}\label{eq:halt:1}
\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{T}) = 
\begin{cases}
1, &amp;amp; \text{if } \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{T}) \text{ halts} \\
0, &amp;amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}\]

&lt;p&gt;Now we construct a new &lt;em&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/em&gt; \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}\).
\(\hat{\mathcal{H}}\) is a slight modification of \(\mathcal{H}\).
It does almost the opposite.
\(\hat{\mathcal{H}}\) halts and outputs 1 if and only if \(\mathcal{H}\) outputs 0.
Furthermore, \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}\) does not halt if \(\mathcal{H}\) outputs 1.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{equation} \tag{2}\label{eq:halt:2}
\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\mathcal{T}) = 
\begin{cases}
1, &amp;amp; \text{if } \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{T}) = 0 \\
\text{undefined, i.e., loops endlessly} &amp;amp; \text{if } \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{T}) = 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}\]

&lt;p&gt;Now we execute \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}\) by feeding it to itself, that is, \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\hat{\mathcal{H}})\) and the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us assume \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\hat{\mathcal{H}}) = 1\).
Following Eq. \eqref{eq:halt:2} gives us \(\mathcal{H}(\hat{\mathcal{H}}) = 0\).
But by following Eq. \eqref{eq:halt:1} this implies that \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\hat{\mathcal{H}})\) does not halt.
After all, \(\mathcal{H}\) outputs 0.
Thus, it recognizes that the analyzed program \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}\) does not halt.
But if \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\hat{\mathcal{H}})\) does not halt, it follows by Eq. \eqref{eq:halt:2} that \(\mathcal{H}(\hat{\mathcal{H}}) = 1\) which leads to a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us assume \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\hat{\mathcal{H}}) = \text{undefined}\).
\(\mathcal{H}(\hat{\mathcal{H}}) = 1\) follows from Eq. \eqref{eq:halt:2} which implies that \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\hat{\mathcal{H}})\) does halts, compare Eq. \eqref{eq:halt:1}.
But if \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\hat{\mathcal{H}})\) halts then by following Eq. \eqref{eq:halt:2}, \(\mathcal{H}(\hat{\mathcal{H}}) = 0\) which leads to a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\hat{\mathcal{H}})\) does lead to a paradox, but the construction of \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}\) is correct if  \(\mathcal{H}\) exists, it follows that our assumption is wrong and \(\hat{\mathcal{H}}\) can not exists!&lt;/p&gt;

The thesis will be published very soon and I post it here on this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following text is from the preface of the thesis and describes my personal struggles during and my perspective on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.” – Albert Camus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-personal-journey&quot;&gt;My personal journey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can pinpoint the exact moment when I decided to start my academic journey. At that time, my life was harshly disrupted by physical illness and the death of my father. Consequently, my family struggled on many levels. Despite, and probably because of the unfortunate circumstances and with my family’s blessing, I quit my job and rejoined school to get my (technical) A level. I wanted to comprehend the world more than ever and escape the meaningless play of presenting. At that difficult time, there was a financial intensive to graduate as fast as possible. Therefore, I did not join the university but the computer science program at the Munich University of Applied Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my undergraduate study, my former naive belief was crushed. I realized that I would never find any definitive objective truth about the physical world. It was a rather pessimistic but also liberating philosophical revelation that there is no definitive rule to follow and no absolute meaning to fulfill. My search was no longer aimed to find an objective meaning but a personal cause to follow. I still admired studying but for other more aesthetic reasons. I loved the clarity and usefulness of formal systems, the beauty of proofs, the elegance of algorithms, and the stu- dent’s lifestyle. I observed a transforming world where computer science spread out into many branches of science, economics, and society. It was a time of playful experimentation and the deconstruction of personal barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got my bachelor’s degree, I finally joined a master program at the Technical University of Munich. This continuation was enabled by the individual and financial support I received from Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes &amp;amp; the Max Weber-Programm. I followed my aesthetic taste and visited rather unpopular formal lectures. At that time, I realized that the source of my personal cause to move on has to be bound to someone else. Beauty and aesthetic theories were a pleasant enjoyment, but they could no longer be the primary reason to live for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly my academic journey should not stop there, since Prof. Dr. Köster invited me into her research group. There are multiple reasons why I happily accepted her invitation. The desire to understand the world was reduced to the desire to understand at least one little part of it. Furthermore, I believed that simulations would influence science, economics, and society for decades to come. And if I could make the world a little bit safer, it might be the cause I was looking for.
During my PhD, the wish to be useful and to help others was always a source of inner conflict and self-doubt. I started the whole journey to escape a world that I perceived to be shallow, empty, and driven by profit. From time to time, the scientific research project felt like this meaningless business world that came back to haunt me. Luckily I was in a superb position. Everyone tried to reduce this aspect of the scientific environment to a minimum, for which I am very grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think every PhD candidate has to deal with uncertainties and self-doubt – the uncertainty within science and the uncertainty of the journey’s path. There is no guaranteed progress or graduation and one is constantly confronted with his or her own limitations. These factors and the ever-present questioning voice in my head acted as a catalyst for an unavoidable existential crisis. I looked into many philosophical ideas and rearranged, and possibly reinforced, my world view and many important values – the chapter’s introductory quotes tell the tale. In my opinion, this process was only possible, because during my academic journey I received the tools to engage with difficult ideas. On the one hand, this crisis was unpleasant but on the other hand it enriched my life – a trade-off I am certainly willing to repeat. In the end, I had supportive companions that helped me to deal with all these issues.
It was not easy, and I guess it rarely ever is, but the struggle is part of the charm – as Camus said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“we must imagine Sisyphus happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, to study is to train thoughtful thinking, perception, awareness, and tolerance. It sharpens the mind and opens up a little less ignorant new world. The ability to enjoy thinking and to share this enjoyment with other thoughtful people provides freedom and independence. It might be the greatest gift I received during my journey. Because of it and the people I met, it is a success story, and I am deeply thankful that I could have experienced it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benedikt Zönnchen</name><email>benedikt.zoennchen@web.de</email></author><summary type="html">Today, I just wanna note that I finally finished my academic journey on the 21st of Mai by successfully defending my PhD thesis.

Likewise to Sonic Pi’s introduction, I will repeat everything I talked about and give some additional insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt; can be used in many very different ways, such as algorithmic composition, sound design, research, and more.
In the following, I concentrate on sound design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that there is a strong connection between &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;Sonic Pi (SP)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;SP&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt; to generate sound, that is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;SP&lt;/a&gt; is used to implement a rhythm, but the actual sound comes from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt;s defined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt; or samples.
Therefore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;SP&lt;/a&gt; can go hand in hand.
I also want to stress that one can implement rhythm and play samples using &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;, but a lot more code is required because &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt; is much more low-level, i.e., more control but less rapid development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;supercollider&quot;&gt;SuperCollider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was motivated by my interest in education and first discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;Sonic Pi (SP)&lt;/a&gt;.
In my opinion, it is a very powerful tool for educational purposes and live programming.
One can rapidly implement a beat or a rhythm and learn the basic concept of structured programming and threads.
Additional effects can be added to the pre-defined &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;synths&lt;/code&gt;, and we can play around with different arguments but changing the sound by those techniques is still limited.
Overall, simplicity is achieved by a lack of control over the sound that is created.
This is not a critic.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;Sonic Pi (SP)&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I wanted more power over what was happening, and since &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;Sonic Pi (SP)&lt;/a&gt; was built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SuperCollider (SC)&lt;/a&gt;, I looked into it.
I most probably would not have got a grasp of it if I had not discovered the excellent tutorials of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/elifieldsteel&quot;&gt;Eli Fieldsteel&lt;/a&gt;, an Assistant Professor of Composition-Theory and Director of the Experimental Music Studios at The University of Illinois.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SuperCollider (SC)&lt;/a&gt; is a package of three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scsynth&lt;/strong&gt;: a real-time audio server, i.e., the part that plays the sound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sclang&lt;/strong&gt;: an interpreted programming language focused on sound. The user can control &lt;strong&gt;scsynth&lt;/strong&gt; by sending messages (Open Sound Control) to the audio server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scide&lt;/strong&gt;: an IDE for &lt;strong&gt;sclang&lt;/strong&gt; with an integrated help system, analyzing tools, and a good documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SuperCollider&lt;/a&gt; is written in C++ and was developed by James McCartney and was originally released in 1996. In 2002, he generously released it as free software under the GNU General Public License. It is now maintained and developed by an active community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;Sonic Pi (SP)&lt;/a&gt; and other tools for algorithmic composition only use the audio server &lt;strong&gt;scsynth&lt;/strong&gt; and replace the other parts with their own programming language and development environment.
Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SuperCollider&lt;/a&gt; is around for some time, it is a very rich environment and language.
However, one can also observe some inconveniences and feel its age.
Nevertheless, it follows interesting concepts that were new to me, and whenever we see new coding paradigms and concepts, we learn something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;programming-sound&quot;&gt;Programming sound&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s observe how the IDE interacts with the interpreter. 
To evaluate a line of code, we press &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shift + return&lt;/code&gt;, and to evaluate a code block, we press &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cmd + return&lt;/code&gt; on the Mac and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crtl + return&lt;/code&gt; on Windows and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;                     &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns 13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;                      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns 9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; One hotkey is very, very important, that is, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cmd + .&lt;/code&gt;.
It stops all sound. 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt; will not protect you from creating a painful or very loud sound.
Where &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;Sonic Pi (SP)&lt;/a&gt; is rather safe, even a small typo can lead to a horrible and even damaging experience in &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;.
Therefore, I recommend using headphones, and before you listen to a new sound, put them off your head and make sure the sound will not blow you away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;booting-the-server&quot;&gt;Booting the server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written a simple extension &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Utils&lt;/code&gt; which boots the server and initializes the windows, i.e., analyzing tools I often require.
The code can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BZoennchen/SuperCollider/blob/main/sc/extensions/classes/utils.sc&quot;&gt;Utils&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call a class function to initialize everything I want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Utils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initTools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that as long as we do not have to communicate with the audio server, i.e., play sound, we don’t need to boot the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variables-and-scope&quot;&gt;Variables and scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we encounter the first inconvenient.
In &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt; there are some special pre-defined variables.
Each single character variable is pre-defined and globally available.
If you come from a modern programming language, this is strange.
However, it is often useful for prototyping in &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercollider.github.io/&quot;&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;.
A very special variable is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, because it holds a reference to the default local server.
Therefore, to start the audio server, we evaluate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;boot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one stops you from overwriting &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, but I would not recommend it.
To define a &lt;strong&gt;code-block&lt;/strong&gt; we use round brackets.
We can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; without defining it because it is already defined for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;results in an error because &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt; is undefined.
The following works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a global variable we can use it everywhere.
Evaluating the line and the code block will return &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;13&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but we can also define a local &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating all these lines will return &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, but the global variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is still &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;.
The following lines cause an error&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while the next lines work and return &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;13&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To define a new global variable, the variable name has to start with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, for example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;returns &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;13&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;functions&quot;&gt;Functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To define a function, we encapsulate its content by curly brackets, and to execute it, we call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;value()&lt;/code&gt; on it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns 10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see another strange behavior: The last line of a function is its return value.
I am not a fan of this shortcut and if you work with &lt;strong&gt;cslang&lt;/strong&gt; you will encounter additional ones.
It adds required knowledge to understand a program written in &lt;strong&gt;cslang&lt;/strong&gt; and steepen the learning curve.
After getting used to it, they speed up the coding a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another example of a function with arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns 17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in Python, one can define a default value for each argument, and we can ignore the order if we add the names.
Furthermore, there is another rather strange shortcut:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;b:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns 17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other parts of the &lt;strong&gt;cslang&lt;/strong&gt;, and if you want to get started, I encourage you to visit the tutorials of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/elifieldsteel&quot;&gt;Eli Fieldsteel&lt;/a&gt; or look at the official documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-first-sine-wave&quot;&gt;A first sine wave&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us create the most simple sound possible: a sine wave.
First, we define a function that can be seen as a process called &lt;em&gt;unit generator&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UGen&lt;/code&gt;) that starts when we call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt;.
There are hundred of different &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UGens&lt;/code&gt;s, they basically spit out real numbers over time.
For example &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SineOsc&lt;/code&gt; samples a sine wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;mul:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sineplay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, the sine wave oscillates between &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.
We define a frequency of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; Hz that is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; cycles per second and a multiple of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/code&gt; such that the amplitude stays between &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-0.2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/code&gt;, which reduces the volume.
Note we that the following two statements are equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;mul:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can change all arguments we defined, for exmple,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sineplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;\freq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;changes sets the frequence to 500 cycles per second which increases the pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;set()&lt;/code&gt; is not called on the function but on the return value of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~sine.play()&lt;/code&gt;!
In fact, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt; is another shortcut to play sound, and behind the scene, it creates a new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt; which I will show in a moment.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt; is excellent to play around and finding a sound, but once you have an idea which direction you want to go, it is better to define a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop the process, i.e., the sine wave, we can call:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sineplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can also press &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cmd + .&lt;/code&gt;, but this will kill all sound not only this sine wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;combining-sine-waves&quot;&gt;Combining sine waves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us define a slightly more complex sound generated by two sine waves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~twosines&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we expect to hear?
Since we add two identical sine waves together, we should hear the same sound but twice as load.
But if we play the sound, it does not fulfill our expectations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~twosines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is another inconvenience: &lt;strong&gt;sclang&lt;/strong&gt; strictly evaluates everything from left to right.
For example, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;3 + 5 * 3&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;24&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;18&lt;/code&gt;.
Therefore, we have to use brackets.
A very useful tool is the build in plotting tool.
We can see the problem more clearly if we plot our function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~twosines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve the desired result, we have to correct the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sinesplay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;freq:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sinesplay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;mul:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;freq:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;mul:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-wobbling-sound&quot;&gt;A wobbling sound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is rather boring.
However, if we change &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/code&gt; such that it is not equal but close to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/code&gt;, we get some interesting effect.
You may want to think about what sound you will hear if you do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sineplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;\freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;201&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hear a kind of wobble effect.
Why?
Well, two sine waves can add up, but they also can cancel each other out.
For example, if we add two sine waves but with phase &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt;, we hear nothing.
This effect is used for noise cancelation in modern headphones.
Apart from some numerical errors, plotting the result reveals the cancelation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;freq:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;phase:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the wobble effect.
Since &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/code&gt; is 1 Hz higher than &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/code&gt;, the second sine wave does one extra cycle for each second.
Therefore, in that time span, the two waves interact between adding up and cancel each other out.
I encourage you to play around.
What will happen if &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/code&gt; is 5 Hz higher?
How does this affect the result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definition-of-a-synth&quot;&gt;Definition of a Synth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I will not go into details because the documentation does a better job than I could ever accomplish.
In the following code snippet, I define a  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt;.
The first argument of the method used to define the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt; is its name. 
The second one is its content.
I call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;add()&lt;/code&gt; to add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt; to the audio server.
You could also call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;store()&lt;/code&gt;, which additionally stores the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt; in a file.
In this way, you can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt; by loading it from a file and with some extra work, we can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt; by
other tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonic-pi.net/&quot;&gt;Sonic Pi&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SynthDef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;\sinewaves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;205&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;freq:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the sound does only come out of one speaker.
The line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;copies&lt;/strong&gt; the sound and sends it to both speakers.
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sig!2&lt;/code&gt; is another handy shortcut for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sig.dup(2)&lt;/code&gt;.
Note that there is no re-evaluation happening, it just copies the result, but we can copy a function!
For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns [[1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rrand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns an array containing three equal elements!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rrand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// returns an array containing three possible different elements!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we defined the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SynthDef&lt;/code&gt;, we can create it, which will immediately start the sound.
We can change all arguments during the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt; lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sinewaves&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;\sinewaves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sinewaves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;\freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;~sinewaves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;\amp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;envelopes-finite-ugens&quot;&gt;Envelopes (finite UGens)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, we had to start and stop the sound by hand.
However, if we want to design a musical instrument, we want to manipulate the amplitude over time.
Imagine a piano: if we hit a key, the sound requires some time to reach its maximum amplitude.
This period is called &lt;em&gt;attacktime&lt;/em&gt;.
After the maximum is reached, it decreases, and if the pianist releases the key, the sound vanishes completely.
There are infinite possibilities. For example, sometimes we want a sustaining sound, i.e., the amplitude stays constant for some period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of &lt;em&gt;maipulation&lt;/em&gt; musicians use the term &lt;em&gt;modulation&lt;/em&gt;.
In general, to achieve more interesing sounds modulation of different arguments is a good practice.
In the following I define an envelope (which I think of as a finite &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UGen&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;EnvGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;levels:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;times:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;curve:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;-3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;height:300px;&quot; src=&quot;/Pages/assets/images/envelope-plot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Env&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The envelope starts at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, increases to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; during &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/code&gt; seconds, drops to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.4&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.4&lt;/code&gt; seconds, and then drops to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/code&gt; seconds.
The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curve&lt;/code&gt; argument influences curvature of the segments.
It can be best understood by plotting the result while playing around with the values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By multiplying the signal of the envelope to our sound signal, we get a sound that stops after &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.6&lt;/code&gt; seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-supercollider highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SynthDef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;\sinewaves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freq2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;205&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a feeling for how a sound changes using different arguments, I recommend to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt; in combination of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MouseX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MouseY&lt;/code&gt;.
The latter two &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UGen&lt;/code&gt;s spit out values that depend on the position of your mouse curser.
Therefore, you can easily change two independently arguments at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SinOsc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;mul:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LPF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;in:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;WhiteNoise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;mul:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;freq:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;EnvGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;perc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;composing&quot;&gt;Composing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composing a whole piece takes time.
One way is first to design your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Synth&lt;/code&gt;s or find proper samples.
Then we need a rhythm and/or melody.
For that purpose, we use some other tools, or we use &lt;strong&gt;sclang&lt;/strong&gt;.
If you want to use &lt;strong&gt;sclang&lt;/strong&gt; a good starting point is to look into the concept of &lt;em&gt;pattern&lt;/em&gt; especially &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PBind&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a better feeling of what is possible, copy the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://sccode.org/1-5bF&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; and execute it in the IDE.
The piece was composed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/elifieldsteel&quot;&gt;Eli Fieldsteel&lt;/a&gt; and makes use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavetable_synthesis#:~:text=Wavetable%20synthesis%20is%20fundamentally%20based,selects%20the%20single%20cycle%20waveform.&quot;&gt;wavetable synthesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benedikt Zönnchen</name><email>benedikt.zoennchen@web.de</email></author><summary type="html">In the past, I did a 15-minute introduction for SuperCollider (SC) for students at my University.

In the following text I want to give the same short introduction either for students to look the information up or for people interested in algorithmic composition.
The aim here is to show how easy it is to make a beat in Sonic Pi.
The implementation is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html&quot;&gt;the beat grid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-beat&quot;&gt;Building a beat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we define an array containing different drum-like samples.
These samples come with Sonic Pi but you can extend the sample library by your own samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;instruments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:bd_haus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:sn_zome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:drum_cymbal_closed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#3&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:drum_cymbal_pedal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:drum_bass_soft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:drum_bass_hard&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We build a four by four beat, i.e., one unit is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.25&lt;/code&gt; beat.
The beat is modelled by an array of length &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;16&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beats1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to address a specific sample by a number between &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;.
Zero means silence!
Therefore, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beat1&lt;/code&gt; starts with the sample &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:bd_haus&lt;/code&gt; followed by silence followed by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:bd_haus&lt;/code&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run the beat we define a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;live_loop&lt;/code&gt; which is a special thread of Sonic Pi.
The content of the thread can be updated dynamically, that is, the user can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;change the content,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;re-evaluate,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;live_loop&lt;/code&gt; will change accordingly.
In the loop/thread we iterate from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;i = 0 ... 15&lt;/code&gt;.
For each iteration we play the beat according to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beat1&lt;/code&gt; and sleep for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.25&lt;/code&gt; beat, since we want to have a 4 times 4 beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;live_loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:drummer1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;instruments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beats1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beats1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.25&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-melody&quot;&gt;Building a melody&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring a little more dynamic into the piece, we introduce a randomly generated melody.
In algorithmic composition we have to find a balance between complete chaos and structure.
To much chaos will sound unpleasant while too much structure is boring.
Therefore, I shuffle a specific scale which gives us notes that fit together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;melody&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shuffle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:e4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:minor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To play the melody we need another &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;live_loop&lt;/code&gt;.
Furthermore, I use a simple sine wave for the melody.
Also note that we play the first and second harmonic as well such that the sound is a little more complex.
It is still very simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;use_synth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:sine&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;live_loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:pianist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;melody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;tick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;amp: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;melody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;look&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;amp: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;melody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;look&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;amp: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-another-beat&quot;&gt;Building another beat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we add another beat and therefore another &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;live_loop&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;beats2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;live_loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:drummer2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we change the beat per minute to 98 which speeds up the whole piece:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;use_bpm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;98&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performing-live&quot;&gt;Performing live&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this gets boring pretty fast but now we can start our live programming to change the sound over time.
For example we can start by one beat, after a while start the second and the melody.
Then we might want to change the melody, for example, the scale.
We can change the beats as well and introduce complete new elements.
Time to play ;)!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benedikt Zönnchen</name><email>benedikt.zoennchen@web.de</email></author><summary type="html">In the past I did a 15 minute introduction for Sonic Pi for students at my University. In the following text I want to give the same short introduction either for students to look the information up or for people interested in algorithmic composition. The aim here is to show how easy it is to make a beat in Sonic Pi. The implementation is inspired by the beat grid.</summary></entry></feed>
