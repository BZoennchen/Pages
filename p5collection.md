# Selected Works

The following collection of animations have neither a particular purpose nor any utility apart from my enjoyment.
I created them by using the JavaScript Library [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).

+ [Global-mean Monthly Temperature](temperature/)
+ [Rotating Lines](rotation/)
+ [Space-filling Curve](sierpinski/)
+ [Elastic Collision](collisions/)
+ [Discrete Voronoi Diagran](voronoi/)
+ [Fourier Drawing](fourier/)
+ [Forest Fire Simulation](fire/)
+ [Fractal Tree](tree/)
